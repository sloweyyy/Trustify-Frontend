# Trustify design revamp progress

All timestamps use Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh (UTC+07). Merge requires Claude’s `review:approved` label.

| Step | PR | Status | Updated | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Brand assets | #8 | Merged | 2026-10-25 | Approved Logo B, favicon and public brand assets. |
| 01 — Tokens and MUI | #9 (superseded; successor pending) | Validation | 2026-10-25 | Existing implementation renamed to required design/01 branch; GitHub closed #9 on branch rename. Theme, auth composition, fonts, AA status colors; build/tests passed. Completing preview QA and review handoff. |

## Remaining sequence

02 shared components → 03 role shells → 04 User creation → 05 User history/payment → 06 User sessions/wallet/profile → 07 Notary → 08 Admin → 09 Public/auth/policies → 10 chatbot → 11 cleanup. Split into smaller PRs where needed. At most two open PRs, each based on latest main.

## Existing infrastructure limitations

- GitGuardian Actions API key is absent/invalid; independent GitGuardian Security Checks passes.
- Secondary Vercel `trustify-frontend` account is blocked; `trustify-notary` deployment works. No environment or secret changes.
- Vercel preview authentication requires the owner’s existing Chrome session. Use that session for required click-through QA; anonymous automation redirects to Vercel sign-in.
